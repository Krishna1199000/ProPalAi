## ‚ú® Features

ProPal AI is built with a focus on delivering a high-performance, secure, and user-friendly experience. Key features include:

*   **Secure Authentication**:
    *   **Credentials (Email & Password)**: Robust login and signup flow with password hashing (bcryptjs) and validation.
    *   **Google OAuth**: Seamless one-click sign-in/signup using Google accounts via NextAuth.js.
    *   **Session Persistence**: Users remain logged in across sessions using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for enhanced security and a smooth experience.
*   **Dynamic User Profiles**:
    *   **Avatar Management**: Users can upload custom profile images (integrated with AWS S3).
    *   **Intelligent Fallback**: If no profile image is uploaded, the avatar gracefully defaults to the first letter of the user's name, maintaining visual consistency.
*   **Intuitive User Interface**:
    *   **Dark/Light Mode**: Animated theme toggle for personalized viewing preference, powered by `next-themes` and Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern, and fully responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring optimal display on all devices.
    *   **Animated Toast Notifications**: Global, accessible toast system (Sonner) provides real-time feedback for actions (e.g., successful login, error messages, profile updates) with smooth animations.
*   **Protected Routes**:
    *   **Dashboard Security**: Sensitive routes (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/settings`, `/profile`) are protected using NextAuth.js middleware, ensuring only authenticated users can access them. Unauthorized attempts are gracefully redirected.
*   **Data Management**:
    *   **Prisma ORM**: Modern, type-safe database toolkit for interacting with PostgreSQL.
    *   **PostgreSQL Database**: Robust and scalable relational database for storing user data, authentication details, and application configurations.
*   **API Integration**: Seamless API routes for handling authentication, data updates, and future AI service integrations.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or higher)
*   npm (v8.x or higher)
*   PostgreSQL database instance
*   (Optional) AWS S3 bucket for profile image uploads

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/propal-ai.git
    cd propal-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the required variables (see `.env Example` section below).

4.  **Database setup:**
    *   Ensure your PostgreSQL database is running and accessible via the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file.
    *   Apply Prisma migrations and push the schema to your database:

        ```bash
        npx prisma db push
        ```
    *   Generate the Prisma client:

        ```bash
        npx prisma generate
        ```
    *   (Optional) Open Prisma Studio to view and manage your database:

        ```bash
        npx prisma studio
        ```

5.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## üìù .env Example

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```dotenv
# Database (PostgreSQL with Prisma)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/propal?schema=public"

# NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="YOUR_NEXTAUTH_SECRET"
# Generate a secure secret using: openssl rand -base64 32

# Google OAuth Provider (for NextAuth.js)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"

# AWS S3 (for profile image uploads)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
AWS_REGION="your-aws-region" # e.g., us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET_NAME="your-s3-bucket-name"

# Add any other environment variables your application might need.
```

## üí° How It Works

### Authentication Flow
The application uses **NextAuth.js** with both **Credentials Provider** (email/password) and **Google Provider** for authentication.
*   **Credentials**: Users sign up with an email and password. Passwords are securely hashed using `bcryptjs` before being stored in the PostgreSQL database via Prisma.
*   **Google OAuth**: Users can sign in effortlessly using their Google accounts. NextAuth.js handles the OAuth flow, and user information is stored in the database.
*   **Session Management**: A JWT (JSON Web Token) session strategy is employed, ensuring that authenticated users remain logged in across browser sessions without needing to re-authenticate repeatedly. Session data is accessible in both client and server components.

### Profile Image Logic
User profile images are stored on **AWS S3**. The URL to the image is saved in the PostgreSQL database (`profileImage` field in the `User` model).
*   When rendering the user's avatar in the sidebar or profile pages, the application first checks for the existence of `user.image` (for Google profiles) or `user.profileImage` (for self-uploaded).
*   If an image URL is present, it's displayed using Next.js's `Image` component with a subtle fade-in animation for a smooth loading experience.
*   If no image is found, a fallback is rendered: a circular avatar displaying the first letter of the user's name, styled with Tailwind CSS to match the application's aesthetic.

### Theme Switch Logic
The application supports a dark/light mode toggle for an enhanced user experience. This is implemented using `next-themes` library, which automatically manages the theme based on system preferences or user selection. Tailwind CSS is configured to apply styles dynamically based on the active theme, ensuring a consistent visual appeal.

### Protected Routes
Essential application sections, such as the dashboard (`/dashboard`), settings, and profile pages, are protected using **NextAuth.js middleware**.
*   The `middleware.ts` file acts as a gatekeeper, intercepting requests to specified routes.
*   It checks for an active authenticated session. If a user attempts to access a protected route without being logged in, they are redirected to the login page with an informative toast notification.

### Toast Notification System
A global, accessible toast notification system is integrated using **Sonner**. This provides immediate visual feedback for various user actions:
*   Successful logins and signups.
*   Authentication failures or network errors.
*   Profile updates and settings saves.
*   Confirmation of sign-out.
*   Warnings for unauthorized access attempts.
Toasts appear at the top-center of the screen, with smooth animations and distinct styling for success (green), error (red), warning, and info messages. They are dismissible by the user or auto-disappear after 3-5 seconds.
